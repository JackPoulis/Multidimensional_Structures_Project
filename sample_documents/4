In computer science, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is an algorithmic technique
that hashes similar input items into the same "buckets" with high probability.[1]
(The number of buckets is much smaller than the universe of possible input items.)
[1] Since similar items end up in the same buckets, this technique can be used for
data clustering and nearest neighbor search. It differs from conventional hashing
techniques in that hash collisions are maximized, not minimized. Alternatively, the
technique can be seen as a way to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data;
high-dimensional input items can be reduced to low-dimensional versions while 
preserving relative distances between items.
