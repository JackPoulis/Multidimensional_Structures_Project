In computer science, a range tree is an ordered tree data structure to hold a list
of points. It allows all points within a given range to be reported efficiently, 
and is typically used in two or higher dimensions. Range trees were introduced by 
Jon Louis Bentley in 1979.[1] Similar data structures were discovered independently 
by Lueker,[2] Lee and Wong,[3] and Willard.[4] The range tree is an alternative to 
the k-d tree. Compared to k-d trees, range trees offer faster query times of (in Big O notation)
O ( log d ⁡ n + k ) {\displaystyle O(\log ^{d}n+k)} O(\log^dn+k) but worse storage of O 
( n log d − 1 ⁡ n ) {\displaystyle O(n\log ^{d-1}n)} O(n\log^{d-1} n), where n is the 
number of points stored in the tree, d is the dimension of each point and k is the 
number of points reported by a given query.
