# Multidimensional_Structures

This project includes 3 tree data structures:
1. K-D tree
2. Quad tree
3. Range tree
And the traditional LSH function to detect similarities in documents

K-D tree and Range tree data structures can store multidimensional points.
Quad tree can only store 2D points. There is also functionality to convert
documents to data points using the vectorize function.
